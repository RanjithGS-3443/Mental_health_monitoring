            Mental health is an important part of our overall well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also determines how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout your life, if you experience mental health problems, your thinking, mood, and behavior could be affected. Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including biological factors (such as genes or brain chemistry), life experiences (such as trauma or abuse), and family history of mental health problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Taking care of your mental health is as important as taking care of your physical health. Regular exercise, proper nutrition, mindfulness, and seeking help when needed are all essential to maintaining mental well-being.
